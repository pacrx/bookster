invariants:
  teleportation_allowed:
    severity: BLOCKER
    explain: true
    variables:
      allowed: false
      used: "${scene.teleportation_used}"
    rule: "used and (not allowed)"
    why: "Teleportation is disallowed by world invariants."
    suggestions:
      - "Rewrite scene without teleportation or change invariant (Tier 3)."

  teleportation_life_cost:
    severity: BLOCKER
    explain: true
    variables:
      teleports: "${scene.teleports_in_scene}"
      cost: 10
      remaining: "${scene.remaining_life_years}"
      total_cost: "teleports * cost"
    rule: "(teleports > 1) or (total_cost > remaining)"
    why: "Teleportation violates max-per-scene or exceeds remaining lifespan."
    suggestions:
     - "Reduce teleport count, reduce cost (Tier 3), or change lifespan via canon delta (Tier 2/3)."
